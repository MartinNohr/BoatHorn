Control a boat horn with international standard signals.
Eventually a bell control will also be added.
This first model uses an M5Stack core esp32 gray. This will probably be changed in the future to a TTGO T1 which has a larger display.
The M5Stack Core2 is also being considered since the gray model has been discontinued.
